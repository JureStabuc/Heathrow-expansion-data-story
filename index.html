          ,html: '<p>After nearly two decades of negotiations, with the early stage of the idea dating back to 2001, the government has accepted the proposal to expand Heathrow airport and build a new runway. It has been a bumpy ride towards this decision, taking into consideration concerns about air and noise pollution and especially completely knocking down homes in the village of Logford, half of Harmondsworth and partly demolishing Sipson. It has been a long journey for decision makers, some of them taking a u-turn and changing their minds and especially frustrating for people who live in surroundings of Europe’s busiest airport.</p>'

          ,html: '<h3>TITLE</h3><p>Two campaigns arose during the government’s decision making, each on their side of the barricade. Robert Barnstone, of Stop Heathrow Expansion (SHE), believes that there is very little plan in place about how to support local people in affected villages. “If you ask Heathrow airport they promised the world to them. Many residents have tried to have negotiations with Heathrow airport to find out their fate. Frankly, when you have to knock down over a thousand homes you have to have a plan where these people are going to go.”</p><p>In his opinion this is only going to add problems to the ongoing London housing crisis. “Where are people going to go and buy a home for the rate of their current home in London?” If not finding a new home in London, many people will be faced with the choice of moving to other parts of the country. “And I do not believe that is a healthy way for our government to behave.” One of SHE’s principal reasons running this campaign is to stand up for the local community. Barnstone added: “We already know that two schools would need to be knocked down. But also people’s places of worship are at stake here as well as the general sense of the community. How will all the children feel, being taken out their schools, especially when the exam period is on? It is not a healthy way to completely tear apart the community this way.”</p><p>Max Wilson from Back Heathrow campaign on the other hand, sees only positive outcomes of the expansion. “Jobs, apprenticeships, opportunities. These are positive elements I see and what is our organisation focused on.”</p><p>With the new runway being built many residents will have to relocate. Heathrow airport faces an expensive compensation bill, up to £1.5 billion. Heathrow has promised a world-class compensation package, something the Back Heathrow group accepts. “But as I said, more than anything people living in those villages but also living in boroughs near the airport in the entire area just wanted clarity and certainty and they have it now,” Wilson concludes. SHE does not believe those promises. “Nothing is really on the paper at the moment. Heathrow airport are saying they will offer market value of the house plus 25%.” But Barnstone believes it is not clear who will actually be entitled to it because the final proposals have not been drawn up. “There will be many who will be left out without any compensation,” he added.</p>'

          ,html: '<h3>TITLE</h3><p>Noise reduction will be amongst most important demands on the agenda when the parliament will vote on the new runway. Being surrounded by villages and towns Heathrow has not many options when it comes to decreasing noise levels when airplanes are waiting in a cue and landing right above local resident’s heads. Despite the expansion and increase in traffic which would come with it, government says, Heathrow airport has made firm commitments to noise reduction. “The government will propose that a six-and-a-half hour ban on scheduled night flights will be introduced for the first time at Heathrow and will make stricter night noise restrictions a requirement of expansion,” explains the government.</p><p>Furthermore, the government proposes new legally binding noise targets, encouraging the use of quieter planes, and a more reliable and predictable timetable that those living under the final flight path could catch a breather. The airport has also pledged to provide over 700 million pounds for noise insulation for residential properties.</p>'

But I do think it is important to point out that many of the noise complaints are made by same people.” He is delighted that Heathrow committed themselves to strict noise conditions and ban on night flights and will be looking to hold the Government and the airport to the account to keep these commitments going.</p><p>But as SHE is explaining, 250 000 extra flights per year are not going to create less noise. It is actually going to create a new flight path “so it means that more people are going to be impacted by aircraft noise, some of them for the first time.” Also the fact that only new and quieter planes will be allowed to use the third runway does not hold the water for SHE. “People will still notice that planes hover over their homes every 90 seconds. Whether the noise reduces for a decibel or two means a lot to statisticians at Heathrow airport but not to people under the flight path.”</p>'

          ,html: '<h3>TITLE</h3><p>Heathrow is Europe’s busiest airport and one of the busiest in the world, serving more than 74 million passengers per year. But with having only two runways and operating at almost full capacity it is falling well behind Paris’s Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt airport and Amsterdam’s Schiphol which have capacity to add new flights to growth markets. According to the government, a new runway at Heathrow would boost Britain’s connection with the rest of the world, supporting trade, exports and job opportunities. It could bring economic benefits to the wider economy worth up to £61 billion.</p>'

As their analysis shows, by 2030 better capacity will see German trade with the BRIC economies alone grow by an additional £15 billion, and French trade grow by £7.5 billion. “This is the trade that could and should be coming here,” CBI states.</p><p>But not only national, also the local economy depends, according to the supporters of Back Heathrow campaign, on the third runway. They see bright future for the local community with 77 thousand jobs and more than 10 thousand new apprenticeships which will be created. “It will have the ability to wipe out youth unemployment, for example in the borough of Hounslow. It will be a huge benefit to local community,” which large part already works at the airport. Wilson adds that the local community is pleased as the areas biggest employer has been secured for themselves and the next generation.</p>'
